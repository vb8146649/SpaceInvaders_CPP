# SpaceInvaders_CPP

Welcome to my Space Invaders game! This is a classic arcade space shooter game created using C++ and the Raylib library. The project is designed to help beginners get started with C++ programming and game development.

## About the Game

This Space Invaders game replicates the classic arcade game where the player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, shooting upwards to destroy waves of descending aliens. The objective is to score as many points as possible by eliminating all the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.

## Getting Started

To download and run this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a C++ compiler (like `g++`) installed.
- Ensure you have the Raylib library installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vb8146649/SpaceInvaders_CPP.git
    cd SpaceInvaders_CPP
    ```

2. Compile the game:
    - Make sure that you `copy` the task.json in your `vscode` and press `F5`.


3. Run the game:
    - The Game shall automatically starts after following the second step if it didn't , Start it manually by running the main.exe file created after Compiling.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move the spaceship left and right.
- **Arrow UP**: Shoot bullets.
- **Esc**: Exit the game.

## Learning Objectives

This is my second project, and I am still learning. The primary goals for creating this game were:

- To understand the basics of C++ programming.
- To learn about classes and inheritance.
- To practice code modularity.
- To add music and keyboard interactions.
- To create graphics in C++.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a basic and easy introduction to C++ projects. It was chosen to help learn and understand the fundamental concepts of game development and C++ programming. It is my second project overall in C++. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!
